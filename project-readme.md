# Smart Community Health Monitoring & Early Warning System

## Problem Statement
**"Smart Community Health Monitoring And Early Warning System for Diseases caused by Various modes of pollution"**

Air pollution, water contamination, noise pollution, and environmental toxins are increasingly causing widespread health issues in communities worldwide. Traditional health monitoring systems fail to proactively detect pollution-related health patterns and provide early warnings before diseases spread. Our solution aims to bridge this gap by creating an intelligent, real-time monitoring system that can identify pollution-induced health risks and alert communities before widespread health crises occur.
